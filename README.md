# eat-them-all


**What inspired me to create Eat-Them-All? **
I love playing board game and I had an idea of creating a game for two players while learning classic snake game and further integerate more technique from other games such as Monopoly, Pacman, DiceRolling..etc. It is a strategy game but also need some dice-rolling luck to win the game!



**Game Rule**
This is a 2-player game. first put your name in the box and start the game! You and your rival will take turn: choose your direction to go and roll the die to eat as many as possible of fruits.  Every fruit eaten your score will +1


**How to win**
The game will end once all the fruits are eaten and nothing left on tha table.  Whoever has highest score once all the table is clear win!

**What's on the gameboard**
two players on the gameboard (player one will be yellow circle / player two will be pink circle) and multiples fruits.  




**Javascript learned **
The game is using techniques from many popular games such as** Pac-man** for circle monthes open and closed and change direction;  **Monopoly's** move base of dice result and handle the event based on the move; **snake-game**'s collision detection and canvas set-up.   

- create Class constructor 
- collission detection
- player in turn
- draw circle and rotate it depending on the moving direction using
- intro page and end page set up
- ramdomise dice and display
